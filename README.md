 ### Developer Story

 I created this project for week 10 of the Full-Stack Bootcamp at JHU. The key topics covered in this unit included: 


    ## Key Topics

* Objects

* this

* Callbacks

* Constructors

* Prototypes

* TDD

* Unit Tests

* Classes

* Inheritance
    
My biggest takeaway from this unit's material is that I am starting to understand web development from a larger-scale perspective. At the start of the bootcamp, I thought about development mostly in terms of writing code for use in creating individual web pages and thier content. After completing this unit, I understand more about how to write reusable code- with potential to apply to many different applications and be relavant to large-scale scenarios. This change in mindsets is exciting I hope to continue learning more throughout the coming weeks.
